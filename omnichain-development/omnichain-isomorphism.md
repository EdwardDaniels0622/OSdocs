# Omnichain Isomorphism

The Map Relay Chain has adopted multiple different chainsâ€™s hashing and signing algorithms as precompiled contracts. Since they are logically fixed and frequently called during cross-chain verification but computationally intensive, precompiled contracts are implemented on the client-side with client code, and because they do not require the virtual machine, they run fast. It also costs less for developers than using functions that run directly in the smart contracts. Omnichain Isomorphism is achieved through the adoption of those precompiled contracts
