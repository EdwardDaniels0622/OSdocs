# üë®‚Äçüíª Butter SDK for Swap

Butter SDK for Swap is aiming to facilitate the development of cross-chain functionality by letting developers integrate asset cross-chain functionality into their application with minimal effort possible.

Any frontend/backend can integrate our TS/JS SDK to achieve cross-chain bridge/swap functionalities. You can choose to build your own UI/UX and leave the complex asset cross-chain work to our SDK.
